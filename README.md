# HandTracking and ASL alphabet recognition using KNN model
Module for handtracking

Data for training ASL model is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

In this project I use mediapipe to extract landmarks from hand images and use them to train a KNN model to recognize American Sign Language alphabets. 
Models were trained with 400 hand LM for each alphabet, space, and delete and achieved an accuracy of 0.968 when tested against 100 hand LM position for each alphabet. 

Thank you for visiting my project!
